# talk-observability

The content found in this repo are for a talk on observability that will be 
presented at nidevconf 2018. The slides for this talk can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RXX74v_0XeNztHIH17_YuTGFHbM5VzfoPP_lf30zyRA/edit?usp=sharing).


### requirements

 - docker-compose version 1.17.1+
 - docker version 1.17.1+
 - free ports 9090 and 8080 (this can be changed in `docker-compose.yml`)

### run

You can run this demonstration using docker-compose by running the following:

```sh
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

This should run all of the required services. You can view prometheus on 
[localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) and you can view nginx (load balancing 
over 3 replica /api/foo services) at 
[localhost:8080/api/foo](http://localhost:8080/api/foo).


### test

The endpoint /api/foo is configured to produce some metrics, visible from the
/metrics endpoint. By loading /api/foo several times, prometheus will start to 
scrape these metrics from each of the underlying docker containers

In prometheus you will see the metrics listed as foo_seconds_bucket, 
foo_seconds_count and foo_seconds_sum.

###Â caveats

The majority of code in this repo is to simply make the demonstration easier for me (Peter McConnell) and does not serve to provide instruction for how you should go about building projects or learning about metrics. That said, feel free to take anything you feel is useful or ask questions about anything that's unclear.
